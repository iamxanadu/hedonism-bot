Today was a rough day. Not so much for me, as for people I care about. I'm planning to stay at MIT for grad school, and both my girlfriend and younger brother were rejected from the graduate and undergraduate programs respectively today. It seems kind of selfish to be sad about this - I should be focused on how they feel - but it is certainly apropo to the bot I am currently planning on writing. But I am also just angry at the pure chance of it all. And the college admission scandles recently aren't helping. Those rich parents should keep there kids at home and leave college for the rest of use who are actually qualified. Anywho, I'm writing a bot for reddit based off of the hedonism bot from Futurama. It will detect hedonistic words or phrases and respond with related quotes. I'm not sure how to spin this in the context of the class, but *something something* instagram vanity, *something something* highlighting people's self-absorbtion on the internet. I thought about writing a twitter bot that tweets text from House and Senate bills too. This would be easier to pitch in the context of the class as a civic bot, but not as fun and I like reddit better. We'll see, maybe I'll make it later. This will be challenging to make. Not the backend, but the front end of matching words to hedonistic quotes. We'll see how it goes.
